Problem 1: Election Result Prediction
You are hired by one of the leading news channels CNBE who wants to analyze recent elections. This survey was conducted on 1525 voters with 9 variables. You have to build a model, to predict which party a voter will vote for on the basis of the given information, to create an exit poll that will help in predicting overall win and seats covered by a particular party.

Problem 2:
In this particular project, we are going to work on the inaugural corpora from the nltk in Python. We will be looking at the following speeches of the Presidents of the United States of America:
1.	President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941
2.	President John F. Kennedy in 1961
3.	President Richard Nixon in 1973
(Hint: use .words(), .raw(), .sent() for extracting counts)
2.1 Find the number of characters, words, and sentences for the mentioned documents. – 3 Marks
2.2 Remove all the stopwords from all three speeches. – 3 Marks
2.3 Which word occurs the most number of times in his inaugural address for each president? Mention the top three words. (after removing the stopwords) – 3 Marks
2.4 Plot the word cloud of each of the speeches of the variable. (after removing the stopwords) – 3 Marks [ refer to the End-to-End Case Study done in the Mentored Learning Session ]
